	<h1>About Me<h1>

	<h2 id="school">School</h2>
	<p>I study Computer Science at Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering, where I'll be completing my Master's next year. Outside of my courses, I've worked for several quarters as an undergraduate TA for several introductory CS courses, in C++, Python, and <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>.</p>

	<h2 id = "research">Research</h2>
	<p>I'm an undergraduate researcher in the HCI-focused <a href="http://delta.northwestern.edu/">Delta Lab</a>, in the <a href="http://dtr.northwestern.edu">Design, Technology, and Research</a> program, advised by Dr. Haoqi Zhang. My research focuses on understanding how reminder systems can support long-term behavior change, such as habit building, using context-sensing and microreminders. A paper summarizing the project is currently under submission to <a href="https://chi2018.acm.org">CHI 2018</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="cs_not_school">CS, but not school</h2>
	<p>Outside of academics, this summer I'm interned for <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/">Braintree</a> in San Francisco in software engineering, working on code-generation tools for REST SDKs as part of the Developer Experience team! Last summer I worked for <a href="https://here.com/en">HERE Maps</a>, where I designed and built a framework allowing our teams to build custom references between map features that sped up my team's processing pipeline by ~50x.</p>

	<h2 id="not_cs">Not CS</h2>
	<p>Beyond CS, I serve as the design supervisor for <a href="vertigoplays.org">Vertigo Productions</a>, a student theater production company dedicated to producing student-written work. I love crème brulée, Calvin and Hobbes, and the color burgundy, and I speak French!</p>
