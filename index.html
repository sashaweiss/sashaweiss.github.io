Outside of my courses, I've worked for several quarters as an undergraduate TA for several introductory CS courses, in C++, Python, and <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>. I'm also spearheading a research project through the <a href="http://dtr.northwestern.edu">Design, Technology, and Research</a> program in the HCI-focused Delta Lab, advised by Prof. Haoqi Zhang; my research focuses on understanding how reminder systems can support long-term behavior change, such as habit building, using smart context-sensing and microreminding techniques.</p><h2 id="cs_not_school">CS, but not school</h2><p>Outside of academics, this summer I'm interning for <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/">Braintree</a> in San Francisco in software engineering, working on code-generation tools for REST SDKs as part of the Developer Experience team! Last summer I worked for <a href="https://here.com/en">HERE Maps</a>, where I designed and built a framework allowing our teams to build custom references between map features that sped up my team's processing pipeline by ~50x. I'm also involved with <a href="http://rheaply.com/">Rheaply</a>, a Chicago-local startup building a platform for the intra-organization exchange of research materials, reducing waste and encouraging collaboration.</p><h2 id="not_cs">Not CS</h2><p>Beyond CS, I serve as the design supervisor for <a href="vertigoplays.org">Vertigo Productions</a>, a student theater production company dedicated to producing student-written work. I love crème brulée, Calvin and Hobbes, and the color burgundy, and I speak French!</p><h2 id="contact">Contact me</h2><p>Hit me up at any of the links at the bottom, or grab my resume <a href="../assets/files/resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></h1></h1></section><!-- Footer --><section class="footer"><ul class="icons"><li><a href="mailto:sasha at sashaweiss dot coffee" class="fa fa-envelope"></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sashaweiss" class="fa fa-linkedin"></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/sashaweiss" class="fa fa-github"></a></li></ul><ul class="acknowledgements"><li>Built by <a title="This link designed by @soylentqueen" href="https://output.jsbin.com/meyulug" target="_blank">Sasha Weiss</a></li><li>Last updated June 2017</li></ul></section><script src="assets/includes/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/adjust.min.js"></script></body></html>
