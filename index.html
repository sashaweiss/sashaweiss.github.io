                    I'm a software engineer at Microsoft working on
                    authentication for <a href="https://www.xbox.com">Xbox</a>,

                    I currently work on Xbox's authentication SDK, covering all
                    non-console platforms such as mobile and Windows. Previously
                    at Microsoft I was in the
                    <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams"

                    org, focusing on the iOS client, and before joining
                    Microsoft I interned with
                    <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com">Braintree</a>
                    in San Francisco and

                <p>
                    I studied Computer Science at Northwestern University's
                    McCormick School of Engineering, where I completed my
                    Bachelor's and Master's degrees. While there I served as a
                    TA for several introductory and advanced CS courses, and led
                    a research project in the
                    <a href="http://delta.northwestern.edu/">Delta Lab</a>'s

                    program focused on reminder systems and habit-formation. I
                    was also the design supervisor for Vertigo Productions, a
                    student theater production company dedicated to producing
                    student-written work.
