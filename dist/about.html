			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<h3>Long term goal: get to outer space</h3>
			<p>I study Computer Science at Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering, where I'll be completing my Master's next year. Outside of my courses, I've worked for several quarters as an undergraduate TA for several introductory CS courses, in C++, Python, and <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>. I'm also spearheading a research project through the <a href="http://dtr.northwestern.edu">Design, Technology, and Research</a> program in the HCI-focused Delta Lab, advised by Prof. Haoqi Zhang; my research focuses on understanding how reminder systems can support long-term behavior change, such as habit building, using smart context-sensing and microreminding techniques.</p>
			<p>Outside of academics, this summer I'm interning for <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/">Braintree</a> in San Francisco in software engineering, working on their user-facing SDKs on the Developer Experience team! Last summer I worked for <a href="https://here.com/en">HERE Maps</a>, where I designed and built a framework allowing our teams to build custom references between map features that sped up my team's processing pipeline by ~50x. I'm also on the <a href="http://rheaply.com/">Rheaply</a> team, a Chicago-local startup building a platform for the intra-organization exchange of research materials, reducing waste and encouraging collaboration.</p>
			<p>Beyond CS, I serve as the design supervisor for <a href="vertigoplays.org">Vertigo Productions</a>, a student theater production company dedicated to producing student-written work. I'm counting the days until The Last Jedi release, love crème brulée and the color burgundy, and speak French!</p>
