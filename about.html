            I'm currently in my third year, studying Computer Science at Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering, where my recent coursework has included operating systems, AI and machine learning, and network communications. Outside of courses, I serve as an undergraduate TA for two introductory CS courses, and lead a research project through the <a href="http://dtr.northwestern.edu">Design, Thinking, and Research</a> program in the Delta Lab, advised by Prof. Haoqi Zhang. My research focuses on reminder systems and around-the-home task completion, with application in scaffolding short "microtasks" to achieve complex and abstract goals.

            Beyond academics, this past summer I worked at <a href="https://here.com/en">HERE Maps</a>, where I designed and implemented an extensible framework for internal map-feature lookup in Scala. Since then, I joined the team of <a href="http://rheaply.com/">Rheaply</a>, a local startup building a collaboration platform for university researchers, and this summer I'll be working for <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/">Braintree</a> in San Francisco as a software development intern.

            Outside of CS, I serve as the technical director for <a href="vertigoplays.org">Vertigo Productions</a>, a student theater production company dedicated to producing student-written work. I also saw The Force Awakens four times in the two weeks after it opened, love crème brulée and the color burgundy, and speak French!
