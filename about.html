          I study Computer Science at Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering, where I'll be completing my Master's next year. Outside of my courses, I serve as an undergraduate TA for several introductory CS courses, and lead a research project through the <a href="http://dtr.northwestern.edu">Design, Technology, and Research</a> program in the Delta Lab, advised by Prof. Haoqi Zhang. My research focuses on understanding how reminder systems can support long-term behavior change, such as habit building, using smart context-sensing and microreminding techniques.

					Outside of academics, this summer I'm working for <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/">Braintree</a> in San Francisco as a software engineering intern, working on their user-facing SDKs on the Developer Experience team, and I couldn't be more excited! Last summer I worked for <a href="https://here.com/en">HERE Maps</a>, where I designed and built a framework allowing our teams to build custom references between map features, which sped up my team's processing pipeline by ~50x. I'm also on the <a href="http://rheaply.com/">Rheaply, Inc</a> team, a Chicago-local startup building a platform for the intra-organization exchange of research materials, reducing waste and encouraging collaboration.

          Outside of CS, I serve as the design supervisor for <a href="vertigoplays.org">Vertigo Productions</a>, a student theater production company dedicated to producing student-written work. I saw The Force Awakens four times in the two weeks after it opened, love crème brulée and the color burgundy, and speak French!
